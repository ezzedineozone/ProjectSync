# ProjectSync
This project, i aim to build to a desktop app with the Qt framework that helps with file management locally and through the cloud (popular cloud services like drive, mega etc...) all integrated in one app, aim is to offer flexibility of file management throuhg a simple UI interface
# Architechture
Idea is to make the sync service completely decoupled from the UI interface and they talk to each other through some form of API, at least thats the plan.
# Releases
App still in development, which remains slow as i learn my way through the whole Qt environment
